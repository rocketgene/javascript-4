# javascript-4
Added
- focus state set on start button

Styling
- changed keys style (color, chosen/wrong color, border, width)
- changed background color
- animated display of letter in phrase

Opportunities for improvement: 
- After the game is reset, the selected keys from the previous game flashes from green/red to the default white. Ideally, these keys reset before the screen is loaded, such that the color transition is not seen.
- If the game is over before the letters in the phraseâ€™s animation is finished, it continues to be animated through the overlay. This should be avoided.
- The game currently holds 5 phrases. It would be better if the game generated unlimited number of random quotes by accessing public databases.
